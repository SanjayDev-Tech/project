Python Typing Speed Test:

A simple and clean graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python and Tkinter to test your typing speed and accuracy.

üìù Description
This project is a desktop application that measures key typing metrics:

Time Taken: The total time in seconds to type the given sentence.

Words Per Minute (WPM): The user's typing speed, calculated based on the number of words typed per minute.

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly typed characters compared to the source sentence.

The application provides a new, randomly selected sentence each time you start a test, ensuring a unique challenge with every attempt.

‚ú® Features
Simple Interface: An intuitive and easy-to-use GUI.

Random Sentences: A predefined list of sentences is used to provide a random prompt for each test.

Instant Feedback: Get your results for WPM, accuracy, and time taken as soon as you finish.

Lightweight: Built using Python's standard tkinter library, so no external dependencies are required.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python 3

Tkinter: For the graphical user interface.

time module: For timing the user's typing.

random module: For selecting sentences.
